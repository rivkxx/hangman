# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Hangman in Python. The program chooses a random word, and the user has to guess it by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository or download the `hangman.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `hangman.py` file is located.
4. Run the command `python hangman.py` to start the game.
5. The program will choose a random word, and you need to guess it by suggesting letters.
6. Enter a letter and press Enter.
7. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. Otherwise, you will lose one attempt.
8. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.

## Customization

You can customize the list of words in the `choose_word` function of the `hangman.py` file. Simply modify the `words` list to include your desired words.

## Dependencies

This game is implemented using Python, so make sure you have Python installed on your computer. It was developed using Python 3.7, but it should work with other versions as well.
